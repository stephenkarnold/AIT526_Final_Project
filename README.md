# Semeval 2023 - Task 9 - Multilingual Tweet Intimacy Analysis

<br>
There are 4 programs (ipynb files) 
</br>
<br>
The first 3 programs are written using normal machine learning models like linear regression etc.
</br>
<br>
The first program is filtered for only tweets that are in English and predicting the intimacy rating.
</br>
<br>
The second program is predicting the intimacy rating for all languages
</br>
<br>
The third program is predicting the intimacy rating for each language individually
</br>
<br>
The fourth program is predicting the intimacy rating using pre-trained models. I would recommend running the fourth program on Google Colab as the kernel kept crashing when running it on jupyter notebook. Make sure you are using the T4 GPU as the runtime hardware accelerator.
